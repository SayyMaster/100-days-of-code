# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic HTML and HTML5 modules on freeCampCode

**Thoughts:** I have never used HTML before, however some concepts were very familiar to me. I learnt to add images, bullet and number lists, text field and placeholder texts, form elements, radio buttons and checklists, div elements and defining the head and body of the text.
