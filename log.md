# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic HTML and HTML5 modules on freeCampCode and created a sign up page as practice.

**Thoughts:** I have never used HTML before, however some concepts were very familiar to me. I learnt to add images, bullet and number lists, text field and placeholder texts, form elements, radio buttons and checklists, div elements and defining the head and body of the text. When completing the activity, I used CSS to format the page without completing the relevant modules. I felt that I learnt better through experimenting with code in real projects, such as the challenge then completing modules.
